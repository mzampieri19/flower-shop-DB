This repository holds the code for the data base for my summer 2024 mobile app "Leilyz's flower shop'. 

The databse holds orders and comments from users and they can be accessed through the admin page of the app. 

The database is hosted using render.com and created with mongo atlas, this is a second version of the flower-shop-server, this time with persistance.
